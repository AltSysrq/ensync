`ensync setup` is an interactive process to walk you through the initial \
setup process and to generate a simple configuration automatically. It \
is suitable for many use-cases and is the recommended way to get started.

For example, to sync your whole home directory to a flash drive you have \
mounted on `/mnt/flash`, storing the configuration in `~/.ensync`, you would \
run

        ensync setup ~/.ensync ~ /mnt/flash

Similarly, to instead back up to a server have hosted in a folder named \
\"data\" under your home directory there, you would run something like

        ensync setup ~/.ensync ~ username@yourhost.example.com:data

<local-path> must be a directory that already exists. <config> will be \
created as a directory during the setup process and must not already \
exist. The path in <remote-path> will be created if it does not already \
exist."

As one might expect, `ensync sync` is the main subcommand. When invoked, \

the output of `--itemise`.

along the below spectrum, where \"quiet\" is negative and \"verbose\" is \
positive:

        -âˆž Fatal errors. These cannot be turned off.

        -2 Errors which prevented changes from being applied.

        -1 Warnings about sync conflicts or other irreconcilable situations.

           newly-created directories and deletions of files underneath
           directories being deleted. This is the default.

         1 All changes being made to files.

         2 Verbose informational messages, such as the state of files which are
           not being changed.

process less gracefully (e.g., with `kill -9`) will not result in data loss, \

Like `rm`, this does not remove directories by default. `ensync rmdir` can be \
used to remove known-empty directories. Alternatively, the `-r` flag can be \
passed to `ensync rm` to recursively remove whole directory trees.

If <path> does not start with `/`, it is relative to `server_root` value \
in the configuration. Otherwise, it starts from the physical root of the \
server.

The main use for this command is to remove unwanted logical roots. For \
example, if you had a `myroot` logical root you no longer wanted, you could \
remove it with

        ensync rm -r /path/to/config /myroot"
